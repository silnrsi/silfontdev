# SIL Font Development Guide

> [!NOTE]
> This website is no longer being updated. Revised and improved information can be found in the Fonts topic at [Writing Systems Technical Resources][wstr].

How to build, modify, and contribute to SIL International font projects. It is applicable to the following projects:

- [Andika Mtihani](https://github.com/silnrsi/font-andika-mtihani)
- other projects on [software.sil.org/fonts](https://software.sil.org/fonts)

This site is specifically for SIL font projects, however the content is equally applicable to any other projects that use the open font workflow described here. 

## General Info
- The anticipated content of the book can be found in the https://github.com/silnrsi/silfontdev/blob/master/en-US-weightlist.md document.
- Each page is written in GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and begins with Jekyll front matter which specifies the title, category, weight (page sort order), outline level (similar to the weight, but showing the hierarchy), published status, and layout (page template - bookpage is currently used by all pages).
- The GFM pages are in the en-US folder.
- If you find errors or problems please create Github issues for them. That's the best way to get our attention.
